Dani helped me figure out the file reading part! I was having a hard time figuring out where the read file implementation should go because I wasn;t sure if the file name was considered as an argument or not.

Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
* I found this assignment to be challenging, but rewarding. I learned a lot about how to use a hash map and how to implement a spell checker. I also learned a lot about how to use the command line to run a program. 
* In the past, I have had many technical difficulties in implementing the command line, but this time I was able to do it successfully. I am proud of myself for that. I found one of my biggest struggles to be figuring out how to read the file rather than taking in specific arguments but once I was able to wrap my head around it it turned out ok.
